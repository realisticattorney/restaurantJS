# Restaurant JS

> Project aimed to create different pages connected each through a navbar button, wrapped each of these pages' content within a function exported to a single file (index.js) where all the logic is coded. The project is a second attempt to code using JS as front-end language. Aspect of the pages was incosenquential to the author's goal.
